        <p>
          Only about 25% of the trail is good to ride. 6 mile thrill ride
          through the dense pine forest of the park. The valley to your left
          drops away as you climb up and through a shallow waterfall.
        </p>
        <p>
          Short and fast, with a few small jumps and some loose rocks to keep
          you on your toes. Out of the parking lot, take your first left. Plan
          on this ride taking all day, it probably won't, but plan on it anyways
          by starting early.

              <p>Our premium tour</p>
              <p>
                Perfect flow day with hard moist dirt with only 1/2 bird baths
                along the way! You can find everyone out here having fun from
                people in body armor and downhill bikes to families testing
                their kids limits to xc racer types riding intervals. 16 Mile
                Summer Trail was initially a rugged singletrack DH trail
                maintained by local builders since 2008, the State of Alaska
                installed a more user friendly course in 2012.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ride to the top and then down and link it directly into
                Ridegeline (with some double track). Very loose and dry. The
                area is mostly wooded but there are several places that offer
                spectacular views.

              <p>
                The trail can ridden in an hour non stop, but most people take
                multiple hours to session the various steps and drops and take
                photos of the World famous views of Castle Valley. This is a
                legitimate expert-level trail, but much of the difficulty can be
                mitigated by slowing down and picking your line carefully.
                Probably not best to ride.
              </p>
              <p>
                I need to learn how to jump! This is a shuttle access downhill
                trail that is suitable for all ages and multiple different bike
                styles- although best suited for all mountain, dirtjumper or
                full on DH bikes. Hymasa is a bit easier, so if you are unsure
                of your skill, start there, and then climb back up Hymasa to do
                Captain Ahab.

                The trail has good flow with some spicy sections. Most climbs
                are of the paved/fireroad variety, most descents are a mix of
                loose rock, fixed rock, and good dirt. The trails all run
                parallel to the Fountain Place paved road so they can be
                shuttled by car.

                After a few bends in the trail you'll get through this section
                and then start hear the waterfalls in another giant valley that
                you'll ride above. This trail is now a designated one way from
                the Lee's Train/C$ intersection. Out here you will find the most
                legal features including log rides, jumps and rock rolls in

                This is the third downhill only trail on the north side trail
                network. Several high speed, low risk sections take you down the
                sandy open trail for some of the most fun downhills in the area.

                Check yourself before you wreck yourself. If you continue, the
                trail ends at one of the lakes and continues lakeside until
                reaching the point where you began the trail The lake-side bit
                is fairly technical and very fun. It's fire road the entire way,
                absolutely zero singletrack.

                Winding trail with dips, climbs and descents. Built specifically
                for mountain bikes, a flow trail emphasizes speed and rhythm,
                featuring berms, rollers, jumps and other features that are
                designed in a way that uses the rider’s momentum to minimize
                pedaling and braking (think downhill pump track).
