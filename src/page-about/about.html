            <h3>Our Origin</h3>
            <p>
              The trail has good flow with some spicy sections. One of the best
              rides in all of tahoe. Continue pedaling up through the dark
              forest around small bands of shale-laden cliffs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two wheel drifting is likely if you have speed but are not riding
              the top few inches of the berms. Check yourself before you wreck
              yourself. 3.
            </p>
            <p>
              Great trail, with amazing views, but may see a lot of traffic. For
              those that want to get tricksy, there are jumps littered
              throughout the trail as well. The trails have a decidedly old
              school vibe with lots of rocks, roots, tight turns and steep
              pitches and are sure to keep even the most experienced riders on
              their toes.
            </p>
            <p>
              It has a number of blind LH corners so whistle or use a bell so
              you can alert anyone coming the opposite way. It is not hard to
              get to and is very fun to ride. The route begins at the end of
              Quid Pro Flow and an intersection with Three Thirty Eight.

            <h3>Our Path</h3>
            <p>
              Highly advise starting from the Mt. Trail is now covered in snow
              and you can only ride the packed areas from where sledders and
              shredders have packed out a trail. The trails are well drained and
              suitable for riding when wet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Proper sized jumps, berms, rollers and wooden features, so sick!
              It can be accessed from the base at Old Fort Picnic Grounds or the
              base of the upper climb. From here the trail narrows and skirts a
              rocky hillside.
            </p>
            <p>
              Several high speed, low risk sections take you down the sandy open
              trail for some of the most fun downhills in the area. The trail
              has good flow with some spicy sections. Fast and flowing with big
              jump options and some pretty crazy gap jumps.
            </p>
            <p>
              For many mountain bikers and equestrians, this is their favorite
              trail or at least in their top three. Lost Lake starts at its
              namesake trailhead. Very loose and dry.
            </p>
            <p>
              Large group of trees down on northern section of trail, between
              buckhorn and club gap. Tree down near southern trail head. Logs
              are gone!
