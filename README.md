# Noroff FEU - Workflow 2 Course Assignment

Project is set up wiht webpack.

Install project:

```bash
$ npm i
```

### Run webpack-dev-server:

```bash
$ npm run start:dev
```

### Build for production:

```bash
$ npm run build:prod
```

Will delete existing `/dist` forlder, minify images and extract style to file.

## Gulp alternative

I started out with Gulp as the Task Runner, but decided on using the oportunity to get some experience with webpack. Extracted the gulp part into a gist:
